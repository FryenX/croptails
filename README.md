After installation, here’s how to quickly get started:  

• **Running the Game**  
  – Open the project in Godot and press the **Play Scene** button to run the loaded scene.  
• **Exploring Scenes**  
  – Browse the scene tree for various game level configurations and character nodes.  
• **Asset Management**  
  – The project uses preconfigured import settings for texture assets. Modification in Godot’s import settings will allow you to tweak compression and quality settings seamlessly.
  
Below is a sample script snippet demonstrating how to load a texture for a character sprite in GDScript:

------------------------------------------------------
# Sample GDScript snippet in a scene file
extends Sprite

func _ready():
    texture = preload("res://assets/game/characters/character_sprites.png")
------------------------------------------------------  

• **Debugging and Testing**  
  – Use Godot’s built-in debugger to inspect errors and performance.  
• **Customization**  
  – Modify scenes and assets to customize game play for your purposes. Enjoy and experiment! 🎮

The configuration of Croptails is straightforward:  

• **Asset Import Settings**  
  – The project includes tailored import settings for each texture asset (e.g., character_sprites.png, chicken_sprites.png, cow_sprites.png) that determine compression mode, quality, mipmaps, and more. These settings are set within Godot’s Import dock and as documented in the asset files fileciteturn0file12 fileciteturn0file13.  
• **Project Configurations**  
  – The project configuration file (project.godot) contains settings for the game’s resolution, window style, and input mappings. Adjust these settings as needed depending on your testing environment.  
• **Performance Optimization**  
  – Tweak Godot’s export templates and texture compression settings if needed to optimize game performance for your target platform.
